# MADAR-TUN LINGUISTIC ANNOTATIONS

This repository provides a brief description and houses the linguistic annotations for the Tunisian part of the MADAR corpus (Bouamoret et al., 2018). These annotations were created during a research project outlined in the following paper, which has been accepted for presentation at the LDK conference scheduled to be held in Vienna in September 2023: 

* [An Empirical Analysis of Task Relations in the Multi-Task Annotation of an Arabizi Corpus, by Elisa Gugliotta, Marco Dinarelli](http://2023.ldk-conf.org/programme/)

The annotations presented here are the outcome of the same procedure used for the TArC corpus. For additional information and in-depth details, please refer to the TArC repository, or consult the following papers. The papers shed light on the methodology employed and provide a comprehensive understanding of the annotation process carried out for both the MADAR and TArC corpora.

### *Overview of DATA*

In this repository, you will find a collection of linguistic annotations, generated semi-automatically using a [Multi-Task Sequence Prediction System](https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/dinarelm/tarc-multi-task-system): 

* Transliteration into Arabizi (*Arabish* level)
* Token classification: Tokens are categorized into three groups - *arabizi* (representing Arabic words written in Latin script), *foreign* (indicating foreign words), and *emotag* (denoting emoticons or smileys tags).
* Normalization in Arabic Script of the tokens classified as *arabizi* (following the CODA* convention [[1]](#1)).
* Tokenization of the *CODAfied* texts.
* Part-of-Speech tagging for the *arabizi* tokens.
* Lemmatization, in CODA* (Arabic-script)
